        "First, the necessary libraries such as re, nltk, numpy, pandas, BeautifulSoup, and sklearn are imported. The code uses the BeautifulSoup library to remove HTML entities from the reviews. Then, the reviews are cleaned using the cleaner() function, which converts all text to lowercase, removes stop words, and applies lemmatization to the remaining words. The cleaned reviews are then joined and stored in a new column of the DataFrame called \"cleaned_review.\"\n",

In this case, the min_df parameter is set to 0.00096, which means that each ngram (unigram, bigram, & trigram) must be present in at least 23 documents for it to be considered as a token (2400 * 0.00096=23). This is a clever way of feature engineering.\n",

The UMAP algorithm maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space while preserving the structure of the original data. In this case, UMAP is used to reduce the dimensionality of the TF-IDF matrix to 2 dimensions for visualization purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the code uses Plotly to create a scatter plot of the reduced TF-IDF matrix, where each point represents a review. The color of the point represents the rating of the review, and the text associated with each point contains the actual review text and its corresponding rating.\n",
